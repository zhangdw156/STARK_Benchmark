## Dataset Summary

**[STARK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11618)** is a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) on spatial-temporal reasoning tasks, particularly for applications in cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart city infrastructure.

- **Hierarchical Benchmark:** Tasks are structured across three levels of reasoning complexity:
  1. **State Estimation:** Field variable prediction, spatial/temporal localization, and tracking with diverse sensor modalities (range, bearing, proximity, event-based).
  2. **Reasoning Over Estimated States:** Inference of spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal relationships using formal logic frameworks (DE-9IM for space, Allen’s interval algebra for time).
  3. **World-Knowledge-Aware Reasoning:** Context- and knowledge-rich challenges such as intent prediction, route planning, landmark reasoning, and human mobility forecasting.

- **Scale and Diversity:** Contains 25 unique tasks, over 10k challenge instances, and supports open-ended answers.

- **Sensor Modalities:** Simulates real-world data from range sensors, bearing sensors, region (proximity) sensors, and event-based (e.g., TOA) sensors, as well as real and synthetic field variable datasets (e.g., air quality, traffic, temperature).

- **Evaluation Focus:** Tasks are designed to assess both direct reasoning and the ability to generate and execute Python code. Baseline methods include classical geometric algorithms (multilateration, triangulation, Kalman filtering) and FSMs for human activity modeling.

- **Reproducibility:** All [data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/prquan/STARK_10k/edit/main/README.md), [code](https://github.com/nesl/STARK_Benchmark/), and evaluation scripts are open-sourced to encourage benchmarking and method development in spatial-temporal reasoning. Please refer to our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nesl/STARK_Benchmark/).

## Example Use Cases

- Benchmarking LLM and LRM performance in geometric localization, trajectory tracking, spatial/temporal relationship inference, and real-world navigation tasks.
- Evaluating multi-step reasoning pipelines in simulated CPS environments.
- Assessing both direct question-answering and tool-use (Python code generation) capabilities.

## Setup
```
uv sync
```

## How to use

1. Untar the data_final.tar.gz file:
```
tar -xzvf data_final.tar.gz
```
2. Rename the directory:
```
mv data_final_v5/ data
```
3.1 Provide the model name and API credentials. By default the script uses the OpenAI Python SDK. For OpenAI-compatible endpoints such as vLLM, pass `--base_url` explicitly.
```
uv run python main.py --openai $m --api_key $OPENAI_API_KEY --dataset $t --index $i --mode $mode
```
For local vLLM:
```
uv run python main.py --openai qwen3-4b-instruct-2507 --base_url http://localhost:8000/v1 --api_key EMPTY --dataset $t --index $i --mode $mode
```

### Explanations of arguments:
(1) --mode: Choose between {'text', 'code'}. It allows users to specify how LLMs interact with data directly through text or with Python code interpreter.

*mode* \in {'text', 'code'}

```
--mode text
```
(2) --openai: Model name sent to the OpenAI-compatible chat completions endpoint. The value is no longer rewritten by the script.
```
--openai gpt-4o
--openai qwen3-4b-instruct-2507 --base_url http://localhost:8000/v1 --api_key EMPTY
```
(3) --index: The index of data sample provided for LLMs. *index* \in {1, ..., N}
```
--index 1
```
(4) --dataset: The type of spatiotemporal reasoning task in ```./task/*.txt```.
```
--dataset loc_range
```
Those tasks include:
```

```
Example usage:
```
uv run python main.py --openai qwen3-4b-instruct-2507 --base_url http://localhost:8000/v1 --api_key EMPTY --dataset loc_range --index 5 --mode text
```


## Reporting results

After evaluation, summarize all result CSVs under `results/` with:

```
uv run python scripts/report_results.py
```

The report script writes normalized rows, per-task summaries, per-tier summaries, missing cases, and NaN cases to `results/_reports/<timestamp>/`. For a full-suite completeness check against every task in `tasks/*.txt`, add `--expect-all-tasks`.
